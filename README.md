# Mutualzz UI

[Mutualzz UI](https://mutualzz.com/ui) is built for React and with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). It takes inspiration from [MUI Joy](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/) and [MUI Material](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)

## Features

- Full fledged theming system (For now it is very basic, but there are plans to expand it further)
- Components that are customizable to your liking with custom color support (if the component supports color)
